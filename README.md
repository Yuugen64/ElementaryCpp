# ElementaryCpp
Trying to write a small Hello World Program and build it via Vim, Makefile, and Terminal Command.

LEARNING OUTCOMES:
1. Practiced using Vim, including learning how to toggle (i) insert mode and (esc) normal mode.
2. Learned that (:) toggles the command line in Vim, that (q) is used to quit, and (w) is used to save 'write' the file.
3. Learned that you can open any file or create a new file by simply typing 'vim <uniqueFilename>'.
4. Re-iterated how to compile C++ via the command line with ' sudo g++ -o exeName myProgram.cpp '
5. Added an SSH key to my Elementary OS partition via Github, a first on Linux for me.
